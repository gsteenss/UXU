UXU is a collection of utilities to manipulate UZIX[1]
filesystems on non-Uzix systems (mostly Linux). This package
can be modified and redistributed under the terms of the
GNU General Public License, included in the file COPYING.

UXU currently includes 4 general purpose, read-only utilities:

* uzixfsinfo    - show superblock information
* uzixfsls      - list directories (like ls -lR)
* uzixfscat     - print files (from a UZIX fs) on standard output
* mkuzixfs      - create a new UZIX filesystem image

Although these have been developed on Linux, they should work on
any other Un*x, even on Windows under Cygwin.

UXU includes a Linux kernel module for mounting Uzix filesystems
read-write. For documentation of the Linux kernel module, read the
README in the Linux directory of this package.

To compile and install:

(1) edit the Makefile and change the prefix if you want
    ( if you skip this step, the utilities will be installed
      on /usr/local/bin, man pages in /usr/local/man/man1 )
(2) make
(3) (become root) make install

There are man pages for the 4 programs. New programs will come
soon (to allow writing to a UZIX filesystem).

KNOWN ISSUES:

** uzixfscat and uzixfsls will not follow symbolic links.

** the calls in uzixfs.c for writing in the filesystem are likely
   to have bugs, I wrote them first, them wrote the Linux kernel
   module (which does read/write ok), while translating the
   code, I noticed some logic errors, fixed them in the kernel
   module but not in the uzixfs.c that is used by the UXU user
   utilities. If you're going to try writing new utilities based on
   uzixfs.c and uzixdir.c , beware that they're likely to have
   completely wrong functions.

New versions of this package are likely to be
